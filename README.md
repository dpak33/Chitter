The program should work as soon as you've set up your own .env file. I also set the Web Socket port in my .env file, though this may not be necessary. For testing, I've used Chai and chaiHttp on the backend while I've used standard Jest to test on the front end. The first level of the project contains all of the backend files + tests and the second level - named client - contains all of the front end files and tests. I did not create a separate folder for the backend but have it situated at the initial project level. The backend will run after you've written 'npm i', 'npm start'. Then you will need to navigate to the client file to get the front end up and running with the same instructions. Tests can be run using NPM test in both the front end and the backend. I wanted to hand this in before 930am given that I've already been allowed an extension but I will continue working on building further frontend tests. I've used MongoDB to store user data. It's thoroughly tested. The only piece of additional functionality I haven't fulfilled is to be able to see all the peeps while not logged in but this wouldn't be hard to implement. I'll admit that the UI isn't pretty, particularly when logged in, but I wanted to focus more on function over form and, again, feel that this is something that can be modified more easily after the event.
